The coding project we have tested is the Bookstore project, which was developed in our Object Oriented Programming class during our 4th semester, coded in Java. You will be able to find  it attached  as a zip folder,
Until now we have been conducting the creation of some Mock classes and have continued with Unit Testing and Integration Testing. First, each of us was in charge of creating a Mock of Bills, Books and Users classes, in order to make further testing slightly easier and isolate units and control inputs. We started with unit testing for each individual component to verify that they function as expected in the project. Then proceeding with Integration Testing to check interactions between components.
